## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click the 'Fork' button at the top right of this repository
   - Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Zero.git`

2. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 or higher)
   - Install pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm`
   - Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
   - Start the database locally: `pnpm docker:up`
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `apps/mail` and `packages/db` folders
   - Set up your Google OAuth credentials (see [README.md](../README.md))
   - Install database dependencies: `pnpm db:dependencies`
   - Initialize the database: `pnpm db:push`

## Development Workflow

1. **Start the Development Environment**

   ```bash
   # Start database locally
   pnpm docker:up
   
   # Start the development server
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch**

   Always create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Make Your Changes**

   - Write clean, maintainable code
   - Follow our coding standards
   - Add/update tests as needed
   - Update documentation if required

4. **Test Your Changes**

   - Make sure the app runs without errors
   - Test your feature thoroughly
   - Run linting: `pnpm lint`
   - Format code: `pnpm format`

5. **Commit Your Changes**

   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Reference issues and pull requests

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new email threading feature

   Implements #123"
   ```

6. **Stay Updated**

   Keep your fork in sync with the main repository:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

7. **Push to Your Fork**

   ```bash
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

8. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub and click "New Pull Request"
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any relevant issues
   - Add screenshots for UI changes

## Database Management

Zero uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM. Here's how to work with it:

1. **Database Structure**

   The database schema is defined in the `packages/db/src` directory.

2. **Common Database Tasks**

   ```bash
   # Install database dependencies
   pnpm db:dependencies
   
   # Apply schema changes to development database
   pnpm db:push
   
   # Create migration files after schema changes
   pnpm db:generate
   
   # Apply migrations (for production)
   pnpm db:migrate
   
   # View and edit data with Drizzle Studio
   pnpm db:studio
   ```

3. **Database Connection**

   Make sure your database connection string is in both:
   - `apps/mail/.env`
   - `packages/db/.env`

   For local development:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/zerodotemail"
   ```

4. **Troubleshooting**

   - **Connection Issues**: Make sure Docker is running
   - **Schema Errors**: Check your schema files for errors

## Coding Guidelines

### General Principles

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
